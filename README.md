# BustleWebsiteRebuild

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. In addition to this, in order to post a comment to the website, it must have a connection to Firebase. Navigate to `http://firebase.com` and create a free account. From there you can generate an api key which you can copy and paste into a file called api-keys. The user will have to create this file, and to ensure full functionality, said file should be created in the app folder.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Technologies used

The technologies used to develop this application are as follows: HTML5, CSS3, ES6, jQuery, Typescript, Angular5, Node.js and Node package manager (npm).
